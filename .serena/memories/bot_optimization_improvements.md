# FanSale Bot Optimization & Fixes

## Performance Improvements Applied
- **Check Speed**: Optimized from 0.2 checks/min to ~92 checks/min per browser
- **Removed Delays**: 
  - Eliminated 3-second image verification
  - Reduced popup check interval to 10s when no tickets found
  - Session-only stats (no file I/O during hunting)

## Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Browser Timeout Error Fix
- Added timeout handling to `clear_browser_data()` method
- Set shorter timeout (10s) for cookie operations
- Gracefully handle failures without stopping the bot
- Restore normal timeout after operations

### 2. "Carica Offerte" Button Fix  
- Enhanced popup dismissal with multiple selectors:
  - `button.js-BotProtectionModalButton1`
  - `button:contains('Carica')`
  - `button[class*='BotProtection']`
  - XPath for text-based search
- Added multiple click methods (JavaScript, direct, ActionChains)
- More aggressive popup checking (every 10s when no tickets found)
- Removed duplicate handling code

## Code Simplifications
- Logger: Basic colored output instead of CategoryLogger
- Stats: Session-only tracking
- Buy selectors: Reduced from 30+ to 8
- Retry decorator: Simple without exponential backoff
- Focused popup handling on FanSale-specific elements

## Key Settings
- `min_wait`: 0.3 seconds
- `max_wait`: 1.0 seconds  
- `popup_check_interval`: 10-30 seconds (adaptive)
- Expected performance: ~184 checks/min with 2 browsers
