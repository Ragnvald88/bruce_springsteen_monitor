# Akamai Bot Detection Bypass

## What I've Implemented

The "Access Denied" error you're seeing is from **Akamai Bot Manager**, one of the most sophisticated bot detection systems. I've added comprehensive bypass techniques specifically for this protection.

### 1. **Enhanced Chrome Launch Options**
- Added stealth flags to prevent automation detection
- Disabled features that expose browser automation
- Fixed WebRTC and user agent client hints

### 2. **Akamai-Specific Bypass Module** (`src/stealth/akamai_bypass.py`)
- Pre-injects critical JavaScript before page load
- Overrides `navigator.webdriver` property
- Fixes Chrome runtime APIs that Akamai checks
- Implements proper permissions API responses
- Adds canvas fingerprinting noise
- Handles battery API expectations

### 3. **Automatic Challenge Detection**
- Detects Akamai challenges by looking for `_abck` cookies
- Simulates human mouse movements
- Waits for sensor data collection
- Retries after challenge completion

### 4. **Platform-Specific Application**
- Automatically applies bypass for Ticketmaster and TicketOne
- Detects Akamai/EdgeSuite blocks and attempts recovery

## How It Works

1. **Before Navigation**: Critical overrides are injected
2. **During Load**: Akamai sensor data is handled properly
3. **On Block Detection**: Challenge bypass is attempted
4. **Recovery**: Automatic retry with enhanced stealth

## Additional Recommendations

If you're still getting blocked:

### 1. **Use Residential Proxies**
Your IPRoyal proxy should help, but ensure it's:
- Actually residential (not datacenter)
- From Italy for Italian sites
- Not flagged/overused

### 2. **Slow Down Initial Requests**
Add a delay on first visit:
```python
# In monitor_target method, after page creation:
if first_run:
    await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Let Akamai sensors initialize
```

### 3. **Consider Manual First Visit**
- Let the browser open
- Manually complete any challenges
- Cookies will be saved for future runs

### 4. **Rotate User Agents**
The current implementation uses your real Chrome user agent, which is good. But ensure it matches your Chrome version.

## Testing the Bypass

Run StealthMaster again and watch for:
- "üõ°Ô∏è Applying Akamai bypass" message
- "üõ°Ô∏è Attempting Akamai challenge bypass" if blocked
- The page should load after a few seconds

The bypass techniques I've implemented are state-of-the-art for 2025 and should handle most Akamai challenges. If specific sites still block you, it might be due to:
- IP reputation (proxy quality)
- Request rate (too fast)
- Missing cookies from previous manual visits

Let me know if you continue to see blocks and I can add more aggressive techniques!
