# Critical Fixes for Blocking Issues

## Current Situation
- ‚úÖ Proxy is working correctly (Italian IP confirmed)
- ‚ùå Fansale is blocking access (403 error - Akamai protection)
- ‚ùì Ticketmaster status unknown
- üîÑ System is running but likely not finding tickets due to blocks

## Root Cause
The sites are using advanced bot protection (Akamai for Fansale) that requires more sophisticated evasion techniques.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. **Use Undetected ChromeDriver**
Instead of Playwright, consider using undetected-chromedriver which has better anti-detection:
```bash
pip install undetected-chromedriver
```

### 2. **Browser Session Persistence**
The current system creates new browser sessions frequently, which is suspicious. Implement:
- Persistent browser profiles
- Cookie preservation between sessions
- Gradual activity buildup

### 3. **Access Pattern Changes**
- Don't go directly to event pages
- Navigate through homepage first
- Add referrer headers
- Mimic natural browsing flow

### 4. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
- Use the mobile versions of sites (often less protected)
- Try different user agents (mobile/tablet)
- Implement request-based checking with proper session management

### 5. **Manual Cookie Collection**
1. Open a regular Chrome browser
2. Navigate to Fansale/Ticketmaster manually
3. Complete any challenges
4. Export cookies
5. Import them into the automated browser

## Quick Fix to Try Now

1. **Stop the current system**:
```bash
pkill -f "python.*main.py"
```

2. **Try mobile user agent approach**:
Update config to use mobile user agents which often bypass desktop protections.

3. **Use a different entry point**:
Instead of going directly to the event URL, navigate through:
- Homepage ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Artist ‚Üí Event

4. **Session warming**:
Before checking tickets, browse other pages on the site to build up a "normal" session.

## The Reality
These ticketing sites have invested heavily in bot detection. Even with residential proxies and stealth measures, they can detect automated browsers through:
- Browser automation frameworks
- JavaScript execution patterns  
- Network timing analysis
- Behavioral analysis

Consider using a hybrid approach:
- Manual login and session establishment
- Automated monitoring using those sessions
- Human intervention for actual purchases

The blocking isn't due to your proxy or basic stealth - it's sophisticated bot detection that requires either:
1. More advanced evasion (costly and complex)
2. Semi-manual approach (more reliable)
3. Alternative data sources (APIs, mobile apps, etc.)
