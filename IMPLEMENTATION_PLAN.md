# StealthMaster Project Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Good Things About Current Code:
1. **Solid Architecture**: Well-structured with platform-specific handlers
2. **Resource Management**: Has resource manager to prevent memory leaks
3. **Proxy Support**: Already configured with IPRoyal Italian proxy
4. **Stealth Features**: Akamai bypass, fingerprint generation, human behavior simulation
5. **Multi-Platform**: Supports FanSale, VivaTicket, and Ticketmaster
6. **Profile System**: Good profile management for multiple identities
7. **2Captcha Integration**: Already has API key configured

### ❌ Critical Issues:
1. **Over-engineered**: Too complex with multiple modes, excessive logging
2. **Resource Heavy**: Running multiple browsers, contexts unnecessarily
3. **Slow Monitoring**: Polling-based instead of event-driven
4. **Missing CloudFlare Bypass**: No FlareSolverr or proper CloudFlare handling
5. **Session Management**: Poor 8-minute rotation causing detection
6. **No Fast Strike**: Missing rapid purchase execution
7. **Broken Imports**: Many circular dependencies and import errors

### 🚨 FanSale Specific Issues:
- Bot protection triggers after 10 minutes
- Missing proper warmup sequence
- No handling for "Acquista" button speed requirements
- Italian language/region not properly set

### 🚨 VivaTicket Specific Issues:
- Missing codice fiscale (Italian tax code) handling
- Poor ticket type extraction
- No queue handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simplify & Fix Core (Immediate)
1. Strip down to essential features only
2. Fix import issues and circular dependencies
3. Focus on FanSale & VivaTicket only
4. Single browser instance with smart session management

### Phase 2: Speed Optimization (Critical)
1. Pre-load checkout pages
2. Implement instant strike capability
3. Optimize selectors for speed
4. Remove unnecessary waits

### Phase 3: Anti-Detection (Essential)
1. Implement proper CloudFlare bypass
2. Human-like behavior patterns
3. Smart session rotation (7-minute cycles)
4. Italian residential proxy optimization

## New Architecture

```
StealthMaster Lite
├── Core Engine (single browser, fast)
├── Platform Handlers
│   ├── FanSale (optimized)
│   └── VivaTicket (optimized)
├── Strike Engine (< 2 second execution)
├── Session Manager (7-minute rotation)
└── Simple Monitor (efficient checking)
```

## Key Improvements:
1. **Single Browser**: One optimized instance instead of multiple
2. **Pre-warming**: Keep sessions ready at checkout
3. **Instant Strike**: < 2 seconds from detection to purchase
4. **Smart Rotation**: Rotate before detection (7 minutes)
5. **Efficient Monitoring**: Check only what matters
