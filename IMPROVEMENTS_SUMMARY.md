# StealthMaster Improvements Summary

## 1. Files Cleaned Up ‚úÖ
- Moved redundant test files from root to `storage/redundant_files_cleanup/`
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
- Cleaned up `.DS_Store` files
- Organized old/unused files into storage directory

## 2. Blocking Issues Analysis & Fixes üõ°Ô∏è

### Problems Identified:
1. **CDP Detection** - Chrome DevTools Protocol detection causing blocks
2. **WebDriver Detection** - Navigator.webdriver property exposed
3. **Plugin Fingerprinting** - Missing or incorrect plugin data
4. **Canvas/WebGL Fingerprinting** - Detectable patterns
5. **Missing Human Behavior** - Robotic interaction patterns

### Solutions Implemented:

#### Enhanced Stealth v4.0 (`src/stealth/enhanced_stealth_v4.py`)
- **CDP Bypass**: Intercepts and blocks Runtime.enable detection
- **WebDriver Hiding**: Multiple methods to remove webdriver property
- **Plugin Spoofing**: Realistic Chrome plugin array
- **Canvas Protection**: Adds noise to prevent fingerprinting
- **WebGL Spoofing**: Randomizes vendor/renderer info
- **Human Mouse Movement**: Natural cursor patterns
- **Timezone Spoofing**: Sets to Italian timezone
- **Battery API**: Realistic battery status

#### Improved Handler v4.0 (`src/platforms/unified_handler_v4.py`)
- **Better Block Detection**: Checks for multiple block indicators
- **Recovery Strategies**: Exponential backoff and cookie clearing
- **Platform-Specific Configs**: Optimized selectors for each site
- **Resource Blocking**: Blocks tracking and analytics
- **Human Actions**: Random scrolls, pauses, and movements

## 3. Vivaticket Opening Issue üé´
- Added platform-specific wait times and selectors
- Implemented better error handling for slow-loading sites
- Added configurable check intervals per platform

## 4. Purchase Insights & Monitoring üìä

### Purchase Monitor (`src/core/purchase_monitor.py`)
Provides real-time insights including:
- **Ticket Tracking**: Monitors new listings and sold tickets
- **Price Monitoring**: Tracks price changes and drops
- **Activity Detection**: Identifies high-activity periods
- **Alert System**: Notifies of important events
- **Dashboard View**: Text-based summary of all activity

### Features:
- Detects when tickets are sold (disappear from listings)
- Tracks average prices per section
- Shows platform activity status (active/inactive)
- Provides actionable insights and recommendations
- Logs all events for analysis

## 5. Testing & Validation üß™

### Test Script (`test_improved_system.py`)
- Tests enhanced stealth measures
- Validates proxy connectivity
- Monitors for blocks and detections
- Shows purchase insights in real-time

## Usage Instructions:

### 1. Run the improved system:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 2. Test the improvements:
```bash
python test_improved_system.py
```

### 3. Monitor insights:
The system will automatically show:
- Platform activity status
- Tickets found/sold
- Price trends
- Recommendations

### 4. Check logs:
- `logs/purchase_insights/` - Ticket events
- `logs/stealthmaster.log` - Main system log
- `logs/detection_metrics/` - Detection events

## Key Improvements Summary:

1. **Better Stealth**: Enhanced v4.0 stealth engine with comprehensive anti-detection
2. **Smarter Recovery**: Automatic recovery from blocks with exponential backoff
3. **Purchase Insights**: Real-time monitoring of ticket availability and sales
4. **Platform Optimization**: Specific configurations for each ticketing platform
5. **Human Behavior**: Natural interaction patterns to avoid detection

## Recommended Configuration:

1. **Proxy**: Ensure your residential proxy is properly configured in `.env`
2. **Headless Mode**: Set to `false` in config for testing, `true` for production
3. **Check Intervals**: Adjust per platform (20s for Fansale, 25s for Ticketmaster)
4. **Browser**: Use Chrome channel for best compatibility

## Next Steps:

1. Run the test script to validate improvements
2. Monitor the purchase insights dashboard
3. Adjust check intervals based on activity patterns
4. Fine-tune section preferences in config.yaml

The system should now have significantly reduced blocking issues and provide better visibility into ticket availability and purchase patterns.
