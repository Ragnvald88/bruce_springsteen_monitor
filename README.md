## 🆕 Parallel Multi-Browser Bot - Your Brilliant Idea!

After your observation about 10-minute rate limits, we now have a **parallel approach** that's much better:

```bash
python3 fansale_parallel_bot.py
```

**4 browsers hunting simultaneously = 4x better coverage!**

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
python3 fansale_bot.py
```

Then choose:
1. **Parallel Multi-Browser** - 4 browsers hunting (BEST!)
2. **Simple Browser Bot** - Single browser 
3. **Lite Browser Bot** - Low data usage

## 📊 Why Parallel is Better

Instead of 1 browser refreshing fast until blocked, we use:
- 4 browsers refreshing slowly
- Each gets its own rate limit
- No gaps in coverage
- If one fails, others continue

## 🚀 How the Parallel Bot Works

1. **5 Browser Windows Open:**
   - 4 hunters (checking every 12-16 seconds)
   - 1 purchase browser (always ready)

2. **When Tickets Found:**
   - Automatically opens in purchase browser
   - Tries to click and add to cart
   - Also opens in your default browser as backup

3. **Smart Features:**
   - Auto-returns to listing page after login
   - Each browser has its own profile
   - Real-time statistics display

## 💰 Success Without Proxy!

Since you discovered it works without proxy:
- Use the parallel bot for maximum coverage
- Save money on proxy costs
- Your home IP + multiple browsers = winning combination
