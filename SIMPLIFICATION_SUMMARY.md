# FanSale Bot - Implementation Summary

## Latest Update: Ticket Filtering System

### âœ… New Feature: Smart Ticket Filtering
- **Keyword-based filtering**: Target specific sections (e.g., "Prato A")
- **Flexible matching**: ANY or ALL keyword matching modes
- **Test mode**: Preview which tickets match before hunting
- **Always maximizes tickets**: Buys up to 4 matching tickets

### How Filtering Works

1. **Configure Filters**: Enter keywords like "Prato A" or "Tribuna"
2. **Bot Checks Each Ticket**: Extracts text and checks for keywords
3. **Only Buys Matches**: Skips tickets that don't match criteria
4. **Maximizes Quantity**: Tries to get 4 tickets (or as many as available)

### Example Usage

```
ðŸŽ« TICKET FILTERING CONFIGURATION
==================================================

Common sections: Prato, Parterre, Tribuna, Settore

Match mode - ANY keyword or ALL keywords? (any/all, default: any): any
