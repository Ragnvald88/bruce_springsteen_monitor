# FanSale Bot V7 - Critical Fixes Summary

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. **Wrong Environment Variable Name** (PRIMARY ISSUE)
- **V5 (Working)**: Uses `FANSALE_TARGET_URL` ‚úÖ
- **V6 (Broken)**: Uses `FANSALE_URL` ‚ùå
- **V7 Fix**: Restored to `FANSALE_TARGET_URL`

This was causing V6 to not load any URL at all!

### 2. **Broken Ticket Selection Logic**
- **V6 Issue**: Checks `ticket.category not in self.ticket_filters['categories']` but never populates it
- **V6 Issue**: Configuration sets `ticket_types_to_hunt` but purchase logic uses `ticket_filters['categories']`
- **V7 Fix**: Unified to use `ticket_types_to_hunt` consistently

### 3. **Missing Popup Handling Logic**
- **V5**: Has comprehensive `:contains` selector support with XPath conversion
- **V6**: Removed this critical logic
- **V7 Fix**: Restored full popup handling from V5

### 4. **DOM Caching Problems**
- **V6**: Added DOM caching that causes stale element errors
- **V7 Fix**: Removed all caching - direct element finding only

### 5. **Reduced Purchase Button Detection**
- **V5**: 17+ selectors including XPath conversion
- **V6**: Only 5 basic selectors
- **V7 Fix**: Restored comprehensive selector list from V5

## üí° TIPS

1. **Always check your .env file** - Make sure you use `FANSALE_TARGET_URL`
2. **Start with 2 browsers** for testing
3. **Watch the colored logs** - Each category has its own color
4. **Enable 2captcha** for best results
5. **Check popup dismissal** - Should handle "Carica Offerte" button

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Bot doesn't navigate to any URL
- Check .env file has `FANSALE_TARGET_URL` (not FANSALE_URL)

### Tickets aren't being selected
- Verify your category selection in configuration
- Check the colored logs to see ticket categorization

### Popups not dismissed
- V7 restores full popup handling from V5
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Stale element errors
- Should not occur in V7 (no caching)
- If they do, restart the bot
