# StealthMaster Ultimate - What We Need to Verify

## Current Issues & Fixes Applied:

### 1. ‚úÖ Login Process Fixed
- Fansale uses TicketOne SSO (Single Sign-On)
- Process: Fansale.it ‚Üí Click "Accedi" ‚Üí TicketOne login ‚Üí Redirect back
- Fields: `username` (not email) and `password` with id attributes
- Submit button: `id="loginCustomerButton"` with value="Accedi"

### 2. ‚úÖ Proxy Configuration Fixed
- Now properly encodes the password to handle special characters
- Uses IPRoyal proxy from .env automatically
- Skips proxy verification to avoid errors

### 3. ‚úÖ Settings Updated
- `max_price: null` - Will reserve ANY ticket at ANY price
- `quantity: 4` - Will reserve up to 4 tickets
- No interactive prompts - uses .env credentials

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What We DON'T Know for Sure:

### 1. **Ticket Element Selectors**
We're currently looking for:
```
.offer-item
div[class*='offer']
div[class*='ticket']
.ticket-listing
article[class*='ticket']
```

**BUT WE DON'T KNOW** if these are correct for Fansale!

### 2. **Add to Cart Process**
We're looking for buttons with:
```
button[class*="cart"]
button[class*="add"]
button[class*="buy"]
```

**BUT WE DON'T KNOW** the actual button selectors on Fansale!

### 3. **Cart Verification**
We check for:
```
.cart-count
.basket-count
[class*='cart-count']
```

**BUT WE DON'T KNOW** how Fansale shows cart status!

## üîç How to Verify:

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_fansale_structure.py
   ```
   This will show what selectors actually exist on the page.

2. **Manual Login Test**:
   - Log into Fansale manually
   - Go to a ticket page
   - Right-click on a ticket ‚Üí Inspect Element
   - Note the class names and structure

3. **Reservation Process**:
   - Manually try to reserve a ticket
   - Use browser DevTools Network tab
   - See what requests are made
   - Note the button classes/IDs

## üìù What You Can Do:

1. **Run the main script** - The login should work now:
   ```bash
   python stealthmaster_ultimate.py
   ```

2. **Check the logs** - If login works but no tickets found:
   - It means the ticket selectors are wrong
   - We need to update them based on actual Fansale HTML

3. **Send me the results** of:
   - `test_fansale_structure.py` output
   - Screenshot of a Fansale ticket page (when logged in)
   - The HTML of a ticket element (right-click ‚Üí Inspect)

## üí° The Truth:

I've been making educated guesses based on common patterns, but without actually seeing:
- A logged-in Fansale ticket page
- The actual HTML structure
- The reservation button elements

...I can't guarantee the ticket detection and reservation will work.

The login process should work now (based on your fansale_handling.md), but the ticket detection needs verification!
