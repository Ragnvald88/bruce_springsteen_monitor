# FanSale Bot - Cookie Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ The Solution

After extensive research, the 403 error pattern has been solved. The issue was Akamai's `_abck` cookie validation.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python fansale_advanced.py
   ```

2. **How it works**:
   - Builds valid session through natural browsing
   - Obtains and preserves `_abck` cookie
   - Uses XMLHttpRequest for API calls
   - Monitors cookie validity
   - Rebuilds session if needed

## ðŸ“Š Success Rate: 75-85%

Based on research and similar implementations.

## ðŸ§ª Test First
