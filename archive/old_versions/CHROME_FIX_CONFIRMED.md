# Chrome Version Fix - CONFIRMED WORKING ✅

## Problem Solved
The Chrome version mismatch error has been successfully fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Chrome Version Detection
- Your system has Chrome 137 installed
- ChromeDriver was trying to use version 138
- Fixed by implementing multi-version fallback system

### 2. Python 3.13 Compatibility
- Added `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` to main entry point
- Changed `use_subprocess=False` to `True` for proper process handling

### 3. ChromeOptions Reuse Error
- Fixed by creating fresh ChromeOptions for each browser creation attempt
- No longer reusing the same options object

## How It Works Now

```python
# Multi-version fallback system
attempts = [
    (None, "auto-detect"),     # Try auto-detect first
    (137, "Chrome 137"),       # Your Chrome version
    (138, "Chrome 138"),       # Fallback
    # ... more versions
]

# Each attempt gets fresh options
for version, name in attempts:
    fresh_options, _, _ = create_chrome_options()
    driver = uc.Chrome(options=fresh_options, version_main=version, ...)
```

## Test Results
✅ Browser launches successfully using Chrome 137
✅ Navigation to FanSale works properly
✅ Ticket detection functionality confirmed
✅ Browser closes cleanly

## Note
The "ImportError: sys.meta_path is None" at shutdown is a harmless Python 3.13 warning that doesn't affect functionality.
