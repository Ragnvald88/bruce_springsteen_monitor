# ðŸŽ¯ Simple Fix Strategy for FanSale Bot

## The Problem We're Overcomplicating

We've been assuming a two-step process:
1. Find ticket â†’ Click ticket â†’ Find buy button â†’ Click buy

But FanSale might actually work like:
1. Tickets are displayed WITH buy buttons visible â†’ Just click buy!

## Evidence from User

The user provided: `<button data-qa="buyNowButton">Acquista</button>`

This suggests buy buttons are ALREADY on the page, not hidden behind ticket clicks!

## Proposed Simple Fix

Instead of the current complex flow, try this:

```python
# Current approach (might be wrong):
tickets = find_elements("div[data-qa='ticketToBuy']")
click(ticket)
wait()
find_buy_button()
click(buy_button)

# Simpler approach (might be right):
buy_buttons = find_elements("button[data-qa='buyNowButton']")
if buy_buttons:
    # Each buy button is already associated with a ticket!
    click(buy_button)  # This might directly purchase the ticket!
```

## Why This Makes Sense

1. FanSale says clicking buy "bindingly purchases" tickets
2. User sees tickets aren't being reserved despite bot running
3. Bot might be looking for tickets in wrong way

## Quick Test

Run the simple test scripts to verify:
- Are buy buttons visible without clicking tickets?
- Does clicking buy button directly work?
- Is the popup dismissal working correctly?

## The Real Issue Might Be

1. **No tickets available** most of the time (tickets sell fast)
2. **Buy buttons are directly clickable** (we don't need to click tickets first)
3. **We're overengineering** a simple click-to-buy process
