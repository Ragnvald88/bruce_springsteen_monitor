# IMPORTANT: Use the Correct File!

## ❌ WRONG (Old version without fixes):
```bash
python3 fansale_check_fixed.py  # DO NOT USE - This is the OLD version
```

## ✅ CORRECT (Fixed version that works):
```bash
python3 fansale_check.py
```

## Or use the runner script:
```bash
python3 run_fansale.py
```

The confusion happened because:
- Both files claimed to be "FIXED VERSION" in their headers
- The file named `fansale_check_fixed.py` is actually the OLDER version
- The file named `fansale_check.py` is the ACTUAL fixed version with Chrome v137 priority

I've renamed the old file to `fansale_check_OLD_DO_NOT_USE.py` to avoid confusion.
