# FanSale Bot - Ticket Detection Issue Analysis

## Problem Summary
The bot is running but NOT detecting available tickets on the page, even though:
1. Manual inspection shows tickets ARE present
2. Debug script successfully finds tickets with selector `div[data-qa='ticketToBuy']`
3. The bot performs checks but always reports 0 tickets found

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Works:
- ✅ Browsers launch successfully
- ✅ Navigation to target URL works
- ✅ Popup dismissal works ("Carica Offerte" button clicked)
- ✅ Check loop is running (~2 checks/second per hunter)
- ✅ Terminal display updates correctly

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Tickets are NOT being detected by the main bot
- ❌ No tickets are being reserved

## Likely Causes:

1. **Timing Issue**: The bot might be checking for tickets before they're loaded
   - After clicking "Carica Offerte", the page likely reloads or updates via AJAX
   - The bot might be checking too quickly before tickets appear

2. **Page State Issue**: The page might be in a different state when the bot checks
   - Manual debug script waits 5 seconds after popup dismissal
   - Main bot only waits 2 seconds

3. **JavaScript Execution**: Tickets might be loaded dynamically after initial page load

## Debug Evidence:
```
Debug script output:
✅ FOUND 1 tickets with: div[data-qa='ticketToBuy']
   First ticket text: Quantità 2 Ingr. Prato B | Posto Unico Prezzo fisso € 278,30...
```

## Solution:
The bot needs to wait longer after dismissing popups to ensure tickets are fully loaded before starting the hunting loop.
