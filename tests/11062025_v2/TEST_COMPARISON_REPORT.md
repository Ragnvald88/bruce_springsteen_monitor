|----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| navigator.webdriver | ❌ FAILED | ❌ FAILED | **NOT FIXED** |
| CDP artifacts | ✅ PASSED | ✅ PASSED | Maintained |
| Automation flags | ✅ PASSED | ✅ PASSED | Maintained |
| **Overall Success** | 75% (6/8) | 75% (6/8) | **NO IMPROVEMENT** |

### Chrome Runtime Detection
| Detection Test | V1 Result | V2 Result | Status |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why the fixes didn't work:

1. **WebDriver Detection**
   - Enhanced CDP bypass code may not be executing early enough
   - Tests may be checking before our overrides take effect
   - Possible race condition in script injection

2. **Chrome Runtime Detection**
   - Proxy implementation may be incorrect
   - Detection tests might be using different methods than expected
   - Runtime object structure may need different approach

3. **Performance Regressions**
   - Additional memory tracking overhead
   - More aggressive garbage collection causing CPU spikes
   - Cache size limits too restrictive

---

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Revert performance-impacting changes** while keeping memory leak fixes
2. **Debug WebDriver detection** with detailed logging to understand timing
3. **Implement different approach** for Chrome runtime spoofing
4. **Increase cache size limits** to improve hit rate

### Alternative Approaches:
1. **Use undetected-chromedriver** library as base
2. **Implement page.evaluateOnNewDocument** for earlier injection
3. **Consider browser extension approach** for deeper control
4. **Profile performance** to identify bottlenecks

### Next Steps:
1. Create minimal reproduction test for detection issues
2. Benchmark each optimization separately
3. Consider A/B testing optimizations
4. Implement gradual rollout of changes

## 📈 Conclusion

The Version 2 optimizations **failed to achieve their primary objectives** while introducing significant performance regressions. The critical WebDriver and Chrome detection issues remain unfixed, and cache performance actually degraded.

**Final Grade: D** (No improvement from D+)

**Recommendation: Revert to V1** and take a different approach to solving the detection issues without impacting performance.
